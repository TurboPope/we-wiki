# BPEL

The **Business Process Execution Language** is
* An XML-based execution language
* A specification of business processes and interaction protocols for web services
* Integrates and coordinates activities as web services (by using WSDL)
* Executable by process engine.

*Alternative definition*: WS-BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is an XML-based language defining several constructs to write business processes. It defines a set of basic control structures like conditions or loops as well as elements to invoke web services and receive messages from services. It relies on WSDL to express web services interfaces. Message structures can be manipulated, assigning parts or the whole of them to variables that can in turn be used to send other messages.

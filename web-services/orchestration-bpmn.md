# Web Service Orchestration: BPMN

The process layer implements processes by calling the appropriate services ("Orchestration"). The orchestration is itself an executable process, which controls the involved services in a centralized manner.

BPMN (**Business Process Model and Notation**) is a visual language. It describes
* Unstructured control flow
* Data flow

It is
* Intuitive (business user)
* Precise (technical user)
* Extendible and
* Supports use of icons

BPMN models can be transformed to **BPEL models**, which can be executed by a **process engine**.

Wikipdia has a slightly more useful description of the BPMN elements and some examples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation#BPMN_topics>

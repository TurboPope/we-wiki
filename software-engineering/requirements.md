A requirement describes a service to be provided or a property to be met by a system. The requirements list summarizes all requirements agreed between the contractor and the customer.

## Categories of Requirements for Web Applications

### Functional Requirements
The functions the web site must fulfill to support the business objectives. *Note: In this context, business means "the stuff that the website does".*

### Non-Functional Requirements
Include **Look and Feel**, **Usability**, **Legal and security concerns**, **Internationalization** and **Accessibility**.

### Business Requirements
Business requirements document the business functions that the web site will support. This means actual business-functions, like selling, ordering, managing products and customer service.

### Content and Navigation Requirements
Capture all the types of content that will be used on the site:

* What is the purpose of the content?
* How is it related to other content?
* In what format is it available (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, graphic)?
* Who owns it?
* Who maintains and updates it?
* Is there any workflow associated with it?
* How often is it updated?
* Is this content static or dynamic?

This category is specific for web applications.

### Technical Requirements
Technical requirements relevant to the stability of a website include:

* Expected volumes of users
* Expected peak periods of use
* Types of content that will create high load (like video and audio files)
* Security requirements (e.g. access restrictions)
* Performance requirements (e.g., page load time)
* Operating availability (24/7 availability standard for WAs; further requirements e.g. < 1 hour downtime / year); maintenance periods
* Support requirements
* Database sizes (for storing content)
* Types of browsers to support, including browser resolutions

### Presentation Requirements

*Deemed irrelevant for Software Engineering by the slides.*

Focus on web page design.


## Activities in Requirements Engineering
Requirements Engineering (RE) is the process of

* Eliciting
* Specifying
* Validating
* Protoyping
* Managing requirements for software

It is an iterative and cooperative process.

### Elicitation

* Identify stakeholders
* Do interviews and workshops
* Analyze existing documents and legacy software
* Determine existing workflows

### Stakeholders
An individual, group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder)). Possible stakeholders are:

* Customers
* Users
* Content authors
* Web page designers
* Domain experts
* Usability experts
* Marketing professionals
* Developers

Stakeholders often have different objectives and expectations, which may be conflicting. A central challenge to web engineering is identifying the right stakeholders and resolving conflicts under time pressure.

### Mockups
Mockups and prototypes of the finished product help getting early responses from stakeholders.

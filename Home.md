# Technologies used for Web Applications

## Introduction

### Web-Applications
A Web Application (WA) is a software system based on technologies and standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provides Web specific resources such as content and services through a user interface, the Web browser. They must:

* be continuously available (24/7) world-wide
* have short response times
* be easy to use for heterogenous user groups
* have a pleasant look and feel
* be highly secure
* run on a large number of different platforms (e.g., browsers)
* offer up-to-date data from heterogeneous sources
* support exploratory access
* provide correctly implemented functionality

Which can be summarized by the following qualities:

* User-friendliness
* Performance
* Reliability
* Scalability
* Security

Additionally, because auf permanent changes, they require:

* Maintainability, evolvability
* Portability
* Interoperability

#### Web Server
A web server is a program that delivers web pages over the Internet using the HTTP protocol.

#### Web Browser
A web browser is a program that supports rendering of and interaction with web pages written in HTML.

#### Protocol
A protocol is a formal description of message formats and rules for exchanging those messages.

#### Types of Web-Applications
* **Document-centric** Static homepages
* **Interactive** News sites, timetables
* **Transactional** Conference registration, room booking
* **Workflow-based** E-commerce, e-government
* **Collaborative** Groupware, wiki, bscw
* **Portal-Oriented** Search engines, marketplace portals
* **Ubiquitous** Device-independent apps
* **Semantic web** last.fm
* **Social web** Weblogs, Facebook

### Web Engineering
Web Engineering (WE) is the establishment and use of sound scientific, engineering and management principles and disciplined and systematic approaches to the successful development, deployment and maintenance of high-quality Web-based systems and applications.

There are several organizations/consortia which influence Web Engineering by producing (quasi-)standards and keeping catalogues. The most important are:

* W3C
* IETF
* IANA
* ICANN
